Hi, this is Bokai Bi!
  
I'm currently a student at Brown University '26, intending to concentrate in Computer Science.
  
Currently I am planning on fully setting up this account with more info & uploading some of my old projects here once I have time, but before that some things will be missing. Please message me directly for anything regarding them.
  
Feel free to contact me at bokai_bi@brown.edu
